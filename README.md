## Build from sources

The source code uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/guides/#getting-started) as build system which makes it independent of the choice of the IDE.
Most IDEs can import Gradle based project easily, but you could also [install Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/4.6/userguide/installation.html)
and use it from the command line together with your favorite editor.
